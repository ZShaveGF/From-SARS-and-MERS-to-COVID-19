## Abstract  
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have emerged in succession and caused severe respiratory disease. A literature review was conducted to outline the possible transmission routes of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, the natural history of the disease, the global disease burden, and a summary comparing the variability in transmission capacity between the different viruses. The following characteristics of coronaviruses were concluded: 1) the natural histories of the three coronaviruses are highly similar and all can be assessed by constructing SEIAR models for transmission capacity; 2) the natural history parameters of the three coronaviruses differ, with SARS-CoV-2 having the highest proportion of asymptomatic patients, while MERS-CoV has the highest mortality rate, SARS-CoV has the longest incubation period, MERS-CoV has the longest latent period; 3) All three coronaviruses have high and variable transmissibility in the early stages of the epidemic (SARS-CoV-2 > SARS-CoV > MERS-CoV), with varying degrees of reduction in transmissibility in the later stages as time passes and preventive and control measures are implemented; 4) Several key interventions can be used in the early stages of the epidemic such as increasing social distance and several key interventions that reduce the transmission rate coefficient were used to optimize the intervention model. This study summarizes and analyses the epidemiological characteristics of different coronaviruses, their transmissibility and the effectiveness of prevention and control measures for several viruses, which can be used to better understand the transmission characteristics of several highly pathogenic human coronaviruses and possible new coronaviruses in the future and to draw lessons for their effective prevention and control.
